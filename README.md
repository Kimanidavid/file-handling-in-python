# File Handling Project

This program demonstrates basic file handling operations in Python, including reading a file, modifying its content, and writing the modified content to a new file.

## Features

- Reads a user-specified text file.
- Converts the file content to uppercase.
- Writes the modified content to a new file prefixed with `modified_`.
- Displays the contents of both the original and modified files.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

    ```sh
    python file_handling.py
    ```

2. Enter the filename you want to read when prompted.

3. The script will display the original content, create a new file with uppercase content, and show the modified content.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Project Structure
